Ez-Stack
====================

This simple start stack is built with gulp and grunt.

It implements :

* Sass 
* Coffee
* Slim

It create 3 folders :

* src : where you will work
* tmp : compiled javascript, css, and html files
* dist : production folder (minified, concat,...)

Currently, the main file of the application in the src folder is in html because gulp-slim is rendering bad html comment for the bower indications.
